# Consuming CRUD API in ASP.NET Core MVC Project

This project demonstrates how to consume the **CRUD API** (built with **ASP.NET Core MVC** and using SQL Server) from an **ASP.NET Core MVC** client application. The goal is to interact with the API's **Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD)** operations in a user-friendly web interface.


## Overview

This project is an **ASP.NET Core MVC** application that interacts with an external **CRUD API**. It allows users to perform CRUD operations through a user interface. The API being consumed is already hosted (as mentioned in the previous project), and this application acts as a front-end client for that API.

The client uses **HttpClient** to make requests to the API and display the results in a web interface, making it easy to manage data stored in the SQL Server database.

## Technologies Used

- **ASP.NET Core MVC** - for building the web client.
- **HTML/CSS** - for the front-end user interface.
- **HttpClient** - for making HTTP requests to the API.
- **Bootstrap** - for styling the UI (optional).
- **Visual Studio** - recommended for development.
